It covers many of the basics of Quantopian's API, and is designed for those who are new to the platform. All you need to get started on this tutorial is to have some basic [Python](https://docs.python.org/2.7/) programming skills."

    "The first step to writing a trading algorithm is to find an economic or statistical relationship on which we can base our strategy. To do this, we can use Quantopian's Research environment to access and analyze historical datasets available in the platform. Research is a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) environment that allows us to run Python code in units called 'cells'.  \n",
